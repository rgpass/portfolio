          <p>I wanted to make a site that represented my skills and personality better than a resume. My target audience includes CTOs of startups and devs working on challenging open-source projects.</p>

          <p>All the design, prototyping, code, and deployment is my own. Technology used includes: <a>Sketch</a>, <a>InVision</a>, HTML, <a>SCSS</a>, <a>ES6</a>, vanilla JavaScript, and <a>Heroku</a>.</p>

          <p>
            <span class="strong">What I loved about it:</span> was able to apply my design training, went through a high-velocity prototyping process to build it, everything is my own code although I truely stand on the shoulders of giants in terms of inspiration, tutorials, and feedback

          <p>In Traction, Weinberg and Mares talk about how to grow a business -- not just make a product. This is the only book I’ve read that discussed all the strategies a company can grow a business. They also discuss the Bullseye Method of finding out which traction strategies will work with you, all of which require an investment of less than one month and $1,000 to test for viability.</p>

          <p><span class="strong">What I loved about it:</span> the high-level summary, followed by action items, followed by details on how to execute those</p>

          <p>Influence goes through the six principles of persuasion that science currently knows about and has tested. Looking at a summary of the book, you’d be inclined to say, “Duh?” But the details, level of research, and valueable insights can help any sales professional or entrepreneur.</p>

          <p><span class="strong">What I loved about it:</span> the empirical evidence behind each of the influencers, how we auto-respond to so many things, and he covers how to combat it when someone is using it to manipulate us</p>

          <p>After checking Facebook for the 10th time that morning, I decided to start reading Hooked. There were a lot of valuable insights in this book, such as how many products start off as "vitamins" but become "painkillers" as a user gets more invested and how product owners must first understand the emotion that a user has before using the product to enable the use of effective triggers.</p>

          <p><span class="strong">What I loved about it:</span> clear breakdown of the complex, simple action items to make your own product habitual, discussed the ethics of creating a habit versus an addiction</p>

        <div class="content">
          <p>Growth Hacker Marketing was my first book into the world of growth hacking. Before read it I thought the job title of "growth hacker" was silly -- it was just an excuse for people in marketing to use the word "hacker." I was astonished to learn that most growth hackers are programmers who focus on gaining traction through an engineer's mindset: measurable, repeatable, scalable.</p>

          <p><span class="strong">What I loved about it:</span> argued that virality is not luck and must be embedded into the product from Day 1, there were many case studies including Hotmail, Twitter, and Dropbox, was told in a way that made me want to learn more</p>
